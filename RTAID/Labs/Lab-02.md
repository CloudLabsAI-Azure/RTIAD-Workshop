# Document Structure 

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along with associated screenshots that provide visual aid. In each screenshot, sections are highlighted with orange boxes to indicate the area(s) user should focus on.

# Introduction 

In this lab, you will experience a way to handle a continuous stream of real-time data. You will use a Fabric Real-Time Intelligence object called an Eventstream to ingest this data to the Eventhouse you created in the last lab and write some basic KQL queries.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- How to create an Eventstream

- Load Real-time data into a KQL Database

- Write basic Kusto Query Language Queries

# Fabric Real-Time Hub

## Task 1: Create an Event Stream Source 

1.  Open the **Fabric workspace** you created in the last lab. From here we can see the Eventhouse we created.

    ![](../media/Lab-02/image5.png)

2.  Navigate to the "Real-Time hub" where currently we do not see any streams of data. That will change shortly.

    ![](../media/Lab-02/Picture1.png)

3.  Select the **+ Add Source** green button which should be in the upper right corner.

    ![A green and white sign Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image7.png)

4.  A window will open that will allow you to select a source for our stream data. As we discussed before, there are many fantastic options to choose from but for this class we will select the option "Azure Event Hubs".
    
    ![](../media/Lab-02/image8.png)

5.  You are now required to create a connection to the Azure Event Hub.Click on the **New connection** text since you do not currently have a connection.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image9.png)

6.  From your environment details page, copy and paste all the necessary connection settings into the appropriate fields. For these labs we are connecting to an Event Hub which has streaming data being sent from a python notebook. This notebook is creating fake sales transactions at rate of around 3,100 transactions per hour.
    
    Event Hub namespace: **rtiadhub{userid} -- provided by cloudlabs**
    
    Event Hub: **rti-iad-fabrikam**
    
    Shared Access Key Name: **rti-reader**
    
    Shared Access Key: <inject key="rti-iad-fabrikam Primary Key"></inject>

7. Once all properties have been filled out click on **Connect**.
    

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automaticallygenerated](../media/Lab-02/image10.png)

8.  In the configuration of the Azure Event Hub data source, you may need to modify the **Consumer group** of the Event Hub to ensure that you gain access to a unique access point to the stream of data.For this workshop you can leave the "\$Default" value as shownbelow\
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image11.png)

9.  Before we finalize this data source and Eventstream, let's go ahead and rename our Eventstream to something more useful. In the "Stream details\" section on the right select the pencil icon next to the "Eventstream name" and let's call our Eventstream "**es_Fabrikam_InternetSales**".

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image12.png)

10. Now we can click on **Next**, which will take us to a final overview page.
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image13.png)

11. In this overview screen, verify the contents look correct and click
    **Create source**.
    
    **Note:** Your details will differ from what you see in the
    screenshot
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
    generated](../media/Lab-02/image14.png)

12. Once the Eventstream and Eventstream source are created select the
    option "**Open Eventstream**"
    
    ![A screenshot of a
    computer](../media/Lab-02/image15.png)

13. This will take you to the Eventstream user interface. Here is where you will see your source stream of data flowing into our eventstream and we have the ability to add transform events as well.

14. It may take a few moments for your Source to be **Active** but after waiting a few moments, click on the middle icon with the name of your Eventstream on it and then click on **Refresh** if you do not see a preview of the data.

    **Note:** If you receive a "Warning" status around and audit policy,that is fine. The stream will still function
    
   ![](../media/Lab-02/image16.png)

15. You should now see a sample of the data within the bottom window.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image17.png)

17. This will show you a preview of the data that is being received from the Azure Event Hub. If you slide your bottom horizontal scroll bar all the way to the right-side of your preview, you will be able to see the time that the data has been received in the Event Hub in two columns called, **EventProcessedUtcTime** and **EventEnqueuedUtcTime**. This should reflect the current date/time in UTC format.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image18-1.png)

## Task 2: Setup Eventstream Destination

1.  Click on the tile within the canvas area labeled "Switch to edit mode to Transform event of add destination"
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image19.png)

2.  Within the Eventstream user interface, click on the **Transform events or add destination** option to open the drop-down menu.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image20.png)

3.  View the list of available operations that can be made to the stream.

    ![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image21.png)

4.  Look below the operations and you will find the **Destinations** select the option that says **Eventhouse**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image22.png)

5.  A new menu will open on the right-hand side of the screen. The first thing you need to modify for the destination is the **data ingestion mode**. The two options are **Direct Ingestion** and **Event processing before ingestion.** Because we are not going to transform anything in our Eventstream and directly load this information in a KQL database table ensure that you have selected the **Direct ingestion** option.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image23.png)

6.  Modify the remainder of the settings with the following details below.

-   Destination name -- **eh-kql-db-fabrikam**

-   Workspace -- **RTI_username**

-   Eventhouse -- **eh_Fabrikam**

-   KQL Database -- **eh_Fabrikam**

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image24.png)

7.  Click on Save.

8.  With the Eventstream configured, click on the **Publish** button to save this Eventstream and begin your ingestion.

    ![A screenshot of a chat](../media/Lab-02/image25.png)

9.  Choose the **Configure** option within the **Destination** to correctly map the stream to a table in the KQL Database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image26.png)

10. Click on the **+ New table** option underneath the the
    **eh_Fabrikam** database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image27.png)

11. Give the new table the name, **InternetSales** and then click on the checkmark.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image28.png)
    
13. You may need to update your **"Data connection name"** to meet requirements. Let us rename it to **"eh_Fabrikam_es_InternetSales".** Then we can click on **Next**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image29.png)

14. After a few moments of searching for events, the user interface should allow you to see that sample data was found. Click on **Finish** at the bottom of the screen.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image30.png)

15. After this you will be shown a summary. Once you have all green checkmarks, click **close** to move forward.

16. Once you see the user interface showing the mappings from the source to the Eventstream to the destination, you have correctly configured and started a stream of data into your KQL Database.

    ![A screen shot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image31.png)

# Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Task 3: Authoring Kusto Database Queries

1.  Make your way back to your **RTI_username** workspace. You should see the new Eventstream you just created along side all the Evenhouse items.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image32.png)

2.  Open the **eh_Fabrikam** KQL Database item.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/IMG33.png)

3.  Within this experience, you can get an overview of the current structure, size, and use of the KQL Database. Because the Eventstream is sending data to this KQL Database consistently you will notice the amount of storage will increase over time.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image34.png)

4.  Click on the **refresh icon** in the top-right corner of the screen.

    ![A screenshot of a phone](../media/Lab-02/image35.png)

5.  The size of the database should have grown. The value you see may not be exact in comparison to the screenshots in the remainder of the lab. Depending on how long you take to complete the content you will have received less or more records than other members of the class. This is completely fine and will not affect your ability to follow along whatsoever.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image36.png)

6.  Within the database navigation area on the left-hand side of the screen, click on the table within your KQL Database called **InternetSales** and you will see an overview of the table

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image37.png)

7.  This overview will give you metadata details about the table you have created and any actively streaming data with your Eventstream.Again, the size of the table and the number of rows within the table are going to vary from student to student and will not affect your end results of this or any lab. A few additional items to call out on this menu include:

- **Histogram** -- Shows number of rows ingested, time it was last generated and the interval of display
- **Data Preview** -- Shows a preview of the table ingestion results.
- **Schema** **Insights**-- This includes details about the column
name and the data types of the column that can be queried with KQL.Also shows the Top 10 count for the values in the selected column
- **Table Details** -- Shows Compressed and Original size of table,OneLake availability, number of rows in the tables and various other details

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image38.png)

8.  Click on **Explore your data** in the top-right corner.

    ![A white background with black text Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image39.png)

9.  This will open the default KQL Queryset that was created alongside the Eventhouse. There are a few pre-scripted queries that are already authored but need some slight customization. There are also two links to Microsoft documentation that can be helpful when learning KQL or also looking at SQL to KQL conversions which will be discussed later throughout this class.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image40.png)

10. Click on **Line 8** and where the query says, **YOUR_TABLE_HERE**,replace that with the table name, **InternetSales**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image41.png)

11. Highlight **Line 8 and 9** and click on the **Run** button in the top-left corner of the window.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image42.png)

12. The query uses the **take** operator to bring back a specified number of rows. When the query runs it will pull data from the InternetSales table and bring back whatever number of rows you have plugged into the query. For this example, 100 rows will return. The specific rows returned cannot be determined with this operator and the results of your query will vary from the result of others.

    ![](../media/Lab-02/image43.png)

13. Click on **Line 12** and where the query says, **YOUR_TABLE_HERE**,replace that with the table name, **InternetSales**.

    ![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image44.png)

14. Highlight **Line 12 and 13** and click on the **Run** button in the top-left corner of the window.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image45.png)

15. This query uses the count operator. This query will return an aggregated number of records that exist at the time of the query execution on the KQL Database table. Feel free to run this query a few more times and you should notice that the number of records increases after every few seconds.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image46.png)

16. Repeat the previous steps for the final query that is automatically created for you on **Line 16/17** and run the query again.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image47.png)

17. This query will give you the number of records that have been ingested into your table within an hour window. The overall distribution of these records for the data you are currently ingesting will be approximately 4,100 per hour. There will be slight variations within that numbers of transactions per hour though and this query will detail if less or more records were ingested in each window.

## Task 4: Using T-SQL Queries Against a KQL Database

You may be working with the Kusto Query Language for the first time. While this language is intuitive and easy to learn for simple queries,you may want to return the results of a more complex queries than you are currently capable of. Several helpful tools have been included within the KQL Queryset capabilities including converting SQL queries to KQL queries and simply authoring T-SQL queries within the KQL Queryset.
Let's explore!

1.  You need to create a query that returns the number of each product that has been sold. This is something you can quickly do with T-SQL.Within the query window, you can translate your SQL queries into KQL to better understand how to author KQL queries in the future. Start with writing the following command.

    **Note:** Double click the object below in order to be able to copy the text

    ```
    --
    explain
    ```

3.  The comment line "\--" followed by the keyword "explain" will allow you to now create a SQL query and return a result with the KQL query that could be used to achieve a similar query and result. Below input the following query to explain what the KQL query would look like:

    ```
     --
     explain
     SELECT COUNT(OrderQuantity) AS CountOfProducts
             , ProductKey
     FROM InternetSales
     GROUP BY ProductKey
    ```

4. This is a simple SQL query that will retrieve results from the InternetSales table to return two columns, the product key and a count of the number of orders. Because there is an aggregated column and a non-aggregated column, you must use a GROUP BY to return results for each individual product. Run the entire query beginning with the "\--" to the end of the T-SQL query.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image52.png)

5.  The output of the explain query should be a single record with the translated KQL query as the result. Click on the **caret icon (\>)** to expand the results and allow for easier translation.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image53.png)

6.  Click on the query pane highlighted below in orange. This will allow you to select translated KQL query and copy it. Paste this query in the KQL Queryset we have been using

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image54.png)

7.  With the results in your query pane, highlight and run the query to retrieve the results. The **summarize** operator will produce a table that aggregates the content of the input table while determining how to group each record with the **by Product Key** and the **project** operator will select the columns to include, rename,or drop while inserting new compute columns.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image55.png)

8.  Feel free to explore a complete list of SQL to KQL cheat sheet operations at the top of your queryset for additional capabilities and conversions.

    ![A close-up of a message Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image56.png)

9.  Instead of using KQL, another alternative to querying the results of the KQL Database within Fabric is to write and run a T-SQL query.Highlight the original SQL statement that was used to translate the KQL query and run only that.

    ![A screenshot of a computer code](../media/Lab-02/image57.png)

10.  This will also yield perfectly valid results without having to onvert to KQL beforehand.

     ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image58.png)

# KQL Queryset

## Task 5: Working with a KQL Queryset

1.  While most of the queries within this window were automatically created from the user interface, there may be times in the future where you wish to create your own KQL queries from scratch. This can be managed through the tabs feature located at the top. It also should be noted that this Queryset automatically saves periodically.

2.  Notice at the top of the Queryset the default name of our first page is the same name as our database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image59.png)

3.  Let's go ahead and re-name this tab by clicking on the pencil icon,let's call it "**My** **First KQL Query"**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image60.png)

4.  In the future if we would like to isolate our code, we can simply create additional tabs by clicking the "+" icon.
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-02/image61.png)

5.  Return to your **RTI_username** workspace. You should have the following objects present

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-02/image62.png)

# Summary

In this lab, you began by setting up a connection to an Event Hub that has a running stream of data and used an Eventstream to take that data and ingest it into a KQL Database. Once the data was ingested, you were able to author several KQL queries and look at the functionality of using T-SQL to help learn KQL syntax or simply return results with SQL statements.
