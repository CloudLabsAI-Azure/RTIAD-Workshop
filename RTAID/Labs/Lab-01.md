   5. **Reflex:** For automatically taking actions when patterns or conditions are detected in changing data.

   6. **Use a sample:** Sample solution.

      ![](../media/Lab-01/image011.png)

## Task 3: Real-Time Hub

1. Click on the **Real-Time hub** within the Fabric navigation pane on the left side of the screen.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image012.png)

1. On **Welcome to Real-Time hub** dialog, click on **Get-Started**.

2. The Real-Time hub is the single place for streaming data-in-motion across your entire organization. Every Microsoft Fabric tenant is automatically provisioned with the hub. It enables you to easily discover, ingest, manage, and consume data-in-motion from a wide variety of sources.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image013.png)

3. Within the Real-Time hub you have access to three different types of data integration.
   - **Data streams**: For your running eventstreams and KQL databases, all the stream outputs from eventstreams and tables from KQL databases automatically show up in Real-Time hub.
   - **Microsoft sources**: Lists all streaming resources from Microsoft services. Whether it’s Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, or other services, you can seamlessly ingest data into Real-Time hub.
   - **Fabric events:** Events that are generated via Fabric artifacts and external sources, are made available in Fabric to support event-driven scenarios like real-time alerting and triggering downstream actions. You can monitor and react to events including Fabric workspace item events and Azure Blob Storage events.

      ![](../media/Lab-01/image014.png)

4. In the top-right corner of the Real-Time hub, click on the **+ Get events** button.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image015.png)

5. A window will appear and will detail the currently available streams of data that are available to integrate into the Real-Time hub.  This includes a mixture of Azure sources as well as external cloud streaming sources like Amazon Kinesis, Confluent Cloud Kafka, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image016.png)

6. **Close** the Get events window by clicking the “X” in the upper right corner.

# Create Workspace and Eventhouse

## Task 4: Create a Fabric Workspace 

1. Now let’s create a workspace with Fabric license. Select **Workspaces** from the left navigation bar. A dialog opens. 

2. Select **New workspace**. 

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image017.png)

3. **Create a workspace** dialog opens on the right side of the browser. 

4. In the **Name** field enter **RTI_username**.  Use the username provided to you from the environment details. 

   >**Note:** The workspace name must be unique. Make sure a green check mark with “**This name is available**” is displayed below the Name field. 

5. If you choose, you can enter a **Description** for the workspace. This is an optional field. 

6. Click on **Advanced** to expand the section. 

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image018.png)

7. Under **License mode**, make sure **Trial** is selected. (It should be selected by default.) 

8. Select **Apply** to create a new workspace. 

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image019.png)
   >**Note:** If **Introducing task flows** dialog opens, click on **Got it**.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image069.png)

## Task 5: Create an Eventhouse

1. Click the **+ New item** box to find all the items you can create in this Fabric workspace.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image020-1.png)

2. Select the **Eventhouse** option from the drop-down list. As we have talked about this can be looked at similarly to a Lakehouse in that we can store data but focused around real time data.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image021.png)

3. In the window that appears, give your Eventhouse the name, **eh_Fabrikam** and click on **Create**.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image022.png)

4. This is where you will ultimately stream data from various sources through the rest of the training today. When the item is created, a window will appear giving you some details about the Eventhouse.  Click on the **Get started** button.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image023.png)

5. Take a quick tour of the Eventhouse by following the green tooltips on your screen.  This first one shows that an empty Kusto Query Language (KQL) Database was created with the Eventhouse.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image024.png)

6. Follow the remainder of the tooltips around the screen to show you where to create additional databases, check the storage in OneLake of the Eventhouse, check the usage of Fabric resources in compute minutes, and finally see what actions have occurred in the Eventhouse.

7. Within the navigational pane of the Eventhouse, find your KQL Database that was created alongside the Eventhouse.  Click on the ellipses (…) and then select the option **Open in new tab**.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image025.png)

8. This will allow us to still have one tab in our browser to see the overview of our entire Eventhouse and a new tab to focus on the KQL Database properties. One goal that we wish to accomplish in our scenario is ensuring that the data streamed to the KQL database is accessible via OneLake. By enabling this feature, we make the data in this KQL Database easily discoverable through shortcuts to be used in any Lakehouse we may want. Click on the pencil icon next to the **OneLake availability** property.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image026.png)

9. Enable this property by toggling the switch to **Active** and then click on **Done** at the bottom of the window.

   ![](../media/Lab-01/image027.png)

10. Return to your **RTI_username** workspace.

11. If you see the **Task Flows** option, grab the anchor point in the middle of the screen and slide the menu up to the top of your screen to hide. 

    ![](../media/Lab-01/image028.png)

12. You now have the basis for how you will begin to ingest the streaming data into your OneLake.  The next step is to create a stream of data that can receive the data in motion.

    ![](../media/Lab-01/image029.png)

In this lab, we explored the Real-Time Intelligence interface, examined the Real-Time hub, created a Fabric workspace, and an Eventhouse that came with a KQL Database.  In the next lab, you will begin to explore techniques that ingest data from various sources across your data estate to OneLake and do some basic analysis with the Kusto Query Language (KQL).
