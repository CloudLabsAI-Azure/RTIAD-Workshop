# Real-Time Intelligence and Real-Time Hub

## Task 2: Real-Time Intelligence Experience Items

1.  Click on the Real-Time Intelligence Experience.

> ![A screenshot of a computer
> program](.\media\lab-01/media/image19.png){width="5.893910761154856in"
> height="2.7223950131233594in"}

2.  You will be navigated to **Real-Time Intelligence Home page**. You
    will see **Task flow templates**, **Recommended items to create**,
    and **Learn more about Real-Time Intelligence** categories. With the
    **Recommended** category notice the items:

    a.  **Eventhouse:** Used to create a workspace of one or multiple
        KQL database(s), which can be shared across projects. Also
        creates a KQL Database within the Eventhouse.

    b.  **KQL** **Queryset:** Used to run queries on the data to produce
        shareable tables and visuals.

    c.  **Real-Time Dashboard**: A collection of tiles, optionally
        organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and
        a visual representation.

    d.  **Eventstream:** Used to capture, transform, and route real-time
        event stream.

    e.  **Reflex:** For automatically taking actions when patterns or
        conditions are detected in changing data.

height="2.0752701224846892in"}

## Task 3: Real-Time Hub

1.  Click on the **Real-Time hub** within the Fabric navigation pane on
    the left side of the screen.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image21.png){width="1.2501946631671041in"
height="3.1507797462817146in"}

2.  The **Welcome to Real-Time hub** dialogue will open and feel from to
    select **Take a tour** or select **Get Started.\
    \
    **![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
    generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image22.png){width="4.05221675415573in"
    height="2.9355172790901136in"}**\
    **

3.  The Real-Time hub is the single place for streaming data-in-motion
    across your entire organization. Every Microsoft Fabric tenant is
    automatically provisioned with this hub. It enables you to easily
    discover, ingest, manage, and consume data-in-motion from a wide
    variety of sources.

4.  Within the Real-Time hub you have access to three different types of
    data integration.

-   **All Data streams**: For your running eventstreams and KQL
    databases, all the stream outputs from eventstreams and tables from
    KQL databases automatically show up in Real-Time hub.

-   **Streaming sources**: Lists all streaming resources from Microsoft
    services. Whether it's Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, or other
    services, you can seamlessly ingest data into Real-Time hub.

-   **Fabric events:** Events that are generated via Fabric artifacts
    and external sources, are made available in Fabric to support
    event-driven scenarios like real-time alerting and triggering
    downstream actions. You can monitor and react to events including
    Fabric workspace item events and Azure Blob Storage events.

![A screenshot of a
phone](.\media\lab-01/media/image23.png){width="2.635784120734908in"
height="3.7401049868766405in"}

5.  In the top-right corner of the Real-Time hub, click on the **+ Add
    Source** button.

![A green and white sign Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image24.png){width="1.6043908573928258in"
height="0.729268372703412in"}

6.  A window will appear and will detail the currently available streams
    of data that are available to integrate into the Real-Time hub. This
    includes a mixture of Azure sources as well as external cloud
    streaming sources like Amazon Kinesis, Confluent Cloud Kafka, and
    Google Cloud Pub/Sub. There is even some sample data available to
    explore

height="2.3211318897637794in"}

7.  **Close** the Get events window by clicking the "X" in the upper
    right corner.

# Create Workspace and Eventhouse

## Task 4: Create a Fabric Workspace 

1.  Now let's create a workspace with Fabric license. Select
    **Workspaces** from the navigation bar on the left.

2.  Select **New workspace**.

3.  **Create a workspace** dialog opens on the right side of the
    browser.

4.  In the **Name** field enter **RTI_username**. Use the username
    provided to you from the environment details.

> **Note:** The workspace name must be unique. Make sure a green check
> mark with "**This name is available**" is displayed below the Name
> field.

5.  If you would like, you can enter a **Description** for the
    workspace. This is an optional field.

6.  Click on **Advanced** to expand the section.

> ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
> generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image30.png){width="3.3512314085739283in"
> height="3.0096456692913387in"}

7.  Under **License mode**, make sure **Trial** is selected. (It should
    be selected by default.)

8.  Select **Apply** to create a new workspace.

## Task 5: Create an Eventhouse

1.  Click the **+ New** box to find all the items you can create in this
    Fabric workspace.

![](.\media\lab-01/media/image35.png){width="2.716901793525809in"
height="1.2417738407699037in"}

2.  Select the **Eventhouse** option from the drop-down list. As we have
    talked about this can be viewed similarly to a Lakehouse in that we
    can store data but this Eventhouse is focused around real time data.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image36.png){width="2.0497364391951005in"
height="2.4234765966754157in"}

3.  In the window that appears, give your Eventhouse the name,
    **eh_Fabrikam** and click on **Create**.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image37.png){width="3.4002909011373577in"
height="1.9529363517060367in"}

4.  This is where you will ultimately stream data from various sources
    through the rest of the training today. When the item is created, a
    window will appear giving you some details about the Eventhouse.
    Click on the **Get started** button.

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image38.png){width="3.3241251093613298in"
height="3.1277832458442694in"}

5.  Take a quick tour of the Eventhouse by following the green tooltips
    on your screen. This first one shows that an empty Kusto Query
    Language (KQL) Database was created with the Eventhouse.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image39.png)

6.  Follow the remainder of the tooltips around the screen to show you
    where to create additional databases, check the storage in OneLake
    of the Eventhouse, check the usage of Fabric resources in compute
    minutes, and finally see what actions have occurred in the
    Eventhouse.

7.  Within the navigational pane on the left of the Eventhouse, find
    your KQL Database that was created alongside the Eventhouse and
    simply click on it to view the database details

![A screenshot of a
computer](.\media\lab-01/media/image40.png){width="1.7589709098862643in"
height="2.3220942694663167in"}

8.  This will allow us to still have one tab in the left browser pane to
    see the overview of our entire Eventhouse and a new tab to focus on
    the KQL Database properties. One goal that we wish to accomplish in
    our scenario is to ensure that the data streamed to the KQL database
    is accessible via OneLake. By enabling this feature, we make the
    data in this KQL Database easily discoverable through shortcuts to
    be used in any Lakehouse we may want. Locate the **Database
    details** section on the right and toggle **On** the "Availability"
    option.

![A screenshot of a
phone](.\media\lab-01/media/image41.png){width="1.877422353455818in"
height="2.3900273403324586in"}

9.  Return to your **RTI_username** workspace by selecting it from the
    left side of the browser\
    ![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
    generated](.\media\lab-01/media/image42.png){width="0.7115944881889764in"
    height="3.5266940069991253in"}

10. If you see the **Task Flows** option taking up most of the space,
    select the double up arrow on the right-hand side to minimize it\
    ![A screenshot of a
    computer](.\media\lab-01/media/image43.png){width="4.211817585301837in"
    height="2.7014971566054244in"}

11. You now have the basis for how you will begin to ingest the
    streaming data into your OneLake. The next step is to create a
    stream of data that can receive the data in motion.
