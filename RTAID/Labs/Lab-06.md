# Document Structure 

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along with associated screenshots that provide visual aid. In each screenshot, sections are highlighted with orange boxes to indicate the area(s) user should focus on.

# Introduction 

In this lab, you will learn how to leverage Data Activator to create a Reflex to send out alerts from our newly created Real-Time dashboard. As well we will see how we can extend the usage of Reflex to create additional custom alert on the data we are streaming into our Eventhouse By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

-   Creating a Reflex from the Alert Option on a Real-Time Dashboard

-   Using Data Activator Reflex Items to Create More Custom Alerts

# Creating an Alert with Reflex

## Task 1: Use the Real-Time Dashboard to Set Alerts

1.  Use the link [Fabric workspace homepage](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/?experience=kusto&rtpPupr=1) to open the **Fabric workspace** home page for the course and select the Real-Time Dashboard you created in the last lab.

2.  On the **Click Through Rate** visual click on the ellipses (...) and select the option to **Set alert**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/L6T1S2-13-11.png)

3.  A new flyout will open on the right-side of the screen. You can see what you are monitoring from the dashboard including the specific visual that the alert will be affiliated with. The condition is something you have full control over. Modify the **Condition** to **Is less than**.

     ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-06/image7.png)

4.  A new field will appear for you to input a **Value** modify this to be **20**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/image8.png)

5.  You have three possible actions currently available for what type of alert you wish to receive once the Data Activator Reflex item recognizes that your condition has been met. Choose the option of **Message me in Teams**.

     ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-06/image9.png)

6.  Finally, you need to decide the location where you will store the  **Reflex item** that you are creating with this alert. This by default should select your current workspace, but you need to specifically call out a **New item** under the Item drop-down menu.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/image10-1.png)

7.  Rename the item to **CTR Reflex** and then click on **Create**. This will take a few moments to create.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-06/image11.png)

8.  You will receive a validation that the reflex alert was created. Click on the **Open** button to open the Reflex.

    ![A screenshot of a phone](../media/Lab-06/image12.png)

9.  This will take you to the formal **Reflex experience**. From here you can monitor the stream of data in real-time, view the Data that is used to support the Reflex, and create additional Triggers from the same stream.

## Task 2: Test Alert from Reflex Experience

1. In the Reflex experience, click on the pencil icon next to the event name and rename it as **CTR is less than 20**. 

    ![](../media/Lab-06/L6T2S1-13-11.png)

2.  From the **CTR is less than 20** trigger select the **Definition** and click on **Send me a test action** button to get a sample message in teams from the Reflex.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/L6T2S2-13-11.png)
  
3.  Open a New tab within your Environment Edge Browser and go to **[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/)**.

4.  Sign in with your environment credentials if you are asked. A message to start a trial may appear and you will want to accept this.

5.  You should have a message within teams letting you know that the CTR is less than 20.

    ![A screenshot of a computer error message](../media/Lab-06/image15.png)

6.  Navigate back to the Reflex experience and let's create another trigger.

## Task 3: Create A New Alert Rule from Data Stream

1.  Select the **KQL Source Event (1)** and click on **New rule (2)** from this data stream.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/L6T3S1-13-11.png)
    
2.  Click on the **pencil** icon and give this Rule the name, **Clicks Greater Than 30,000** (you can choose a value here that falls more in line with however much data you have streamed in).

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-06/L6T3S2-13-11.png)

3.  To begin, you need to monitor one of the columns from the data stream. Now we will need to add the Condition and Action to this rule. Click on the Definition tab of the rule to set the conditions and action.

4. In the Definition page that opens, in **Condition** select the following properties,
    - **Operation** - Is greater than (1)
    - **Column** - clicks (2)
    - **Value** - 30000 (3)

    In the **Action**, select the below properties,
    - **Type** - Teams message (4)
    - **Recipient** - ODL_User_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (5)
    - **Headline** - Clicks Greater than 30,000 (6)

    - Finally, click on **Start (7)** to run the rule.

        ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-06/create-new-trigger1-13-11.png)

5. You now have two alert rules that are monitoring the same data stream.

# Clean Up Resources

## Task 4: Clean Up Workspace

1.  This is the last lab and last part of Real-Time Analytics in a Day. If you have completed the lab and have no further questions or needs from the instructor on the content, please help us by deallocating the workspace. Navigate to the **RTI_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** workspace.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-06/image28-1.png)

2.  Click on the **Workspace Settings** in the top-right corner.

    ![](../media/Lab-06/image29-1.png)

3.  From the **General** workspace settings, scroll down and click on the **Remove this workspace** button.

4.  Lab and Class Complete!

# Summary

In this lab, we walked through using Data Activator. With this feature you can connect directly to real-time dashboards or streams of data and create triggers on that data. These triggers can then be configured with detection conditions and once those conditions are met and action can be taken. Within this lab we used the ability to send an email when certain conditions were met within our triggers. Data Activator is still in preview so new actions may be come available in the future.
