# Real-Time Intelligence and Real-Time Hub

## Task 2: Real-Time Intelligence Experience Items

1.  Click on the Real-Time Intelligence Experience.

> ![A screenshot of a
> computer](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image19.png){width="5.48587489063867in"
> height="2.2043022747156606in"}

2.  You will be navigated to **Real-Time Intelligence Home page**. You
    will see **New**, **Recommended**, and **Quick Access** categories.
    With the **New** category notice the items:

    a.  **Eventhouse:** Used to create a workspace of one or multiple
        KQL database(s), which can be shared across projects. Also
        creates a KQL Database within the Eventhouse.

    b.  **KQL** **Queryset:** Used to run queries on the data to produce
        shareable tables and visuals.

    c.  **Real-Time Dashboard**: A collection of tiles, optionally
        organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and
        a visual representation.

    d.  **Eventstream:** Used to capture, transform, and route real-time
        event stream.

    e.  **Reflex:** For automatically taking actions when patterns or
        conditions are detected in changing data.

    f.  **Use a sample:** Sample solution.

height="2.2521533245844267in"}

2.  The Real-Time hub is the single place for streaming data-in-motion
    across your entire organization. Every Microsoft Fabric tenant is
    automatically provisioned with the hub. It enables you to easily
    discover, ingest, manage, and consume data-in-motion from a wide
    variety of sources.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image23.png){width="6.015422134733158in"
height="1.9651235783027121in"}

3.  Within the Real-Time hub you have access to three different types of
    data integration.

-   **Data streams**: For your running eventstreams and KQL databases,
    all the stream outputs from eventstreams and tables from KQL
    databases automatically show up in Real-Time hub.

-   **Microsoft sources**: Lists all streaming resources from Microsoft
    services. Whether it's Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, or other
    services, you can seamlessly ingest data into Real-Time hub.

-   **Fabric events:** Events that are generated via Fabric artifacts
    and external sources, are made available in Fabric to support
    event-driven scenarios like real-time alerting and triggering
    downstream actions. You can monitor and react to events including
    Fabric workspace item events and Azure Blob Storage events.

height="0.864067147856518in"}

5.  A window will appear and will detail the currently available streams
    of data that are available to integrate into the Real-Time hub. This
    includes a mixture of Azure sources as well as external cloud
    streaming sources like Amazon Kinesis, Confluent Cloud Kafka, and
    Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

height="2.3211318897637794in"}

6.  **Close** the Get events window by clicking the "X" in the upper
    right corner.

# Create Workspace and Eventhouse

## Task 4: Create a Fabric Workspace 

1.  Now let's create a workspace with Fabric license. Select
    **Workspaces** from the left navigation bar. A dialog opens.

2.  Select **New workspace**.

> ![](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image28.png){width="2.3794444444444443in"

> height="3.933333333333333in"}

3.  **Create a workspace** dialog opens on the right side of the
    browser.

4.  In the **Name** field enter **RTI_username**. Use the username
    provided to you from the environment details.

> **Note:** The workspace name must be unique. Make sure a green check
> mark with "**This name is available**" is displayed below the Name
> field.

5.  If you choose, you can enter a **Description** for the workspace.
    This is an optional field.

6.  Click on **Advanced** to expand the section.

> ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
> generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image30.png){width="3.3512314085739283in"
> height="3.0096456692913387in"}

7.  Under **License mode**, make sure **Trial** is selected. (It should
    be selected by default.)

8.  Select **Apply** to create a new workspace.

> ![](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image31.png){width="3.1433333333333335in"

> height="2.285416666666667in"}

## Task 5: Create an Eventhouse

1.  Click the **+ New** box to find all the items you can create in this
    Fabric workspace.

![](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image33.png){width="2.716901793525809in"
height="1.2417738407699037in"}

2.  Select the **Eventhouse** option from the drop-down list. As we have
    talked about this can be looked at similarly to a Lakehouse in that
    we can store data but focused around real time data.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image34.png){width="2.0497364391951005in"
height="2.4234765966754157in"}

3.  In the window that appears, give your Eventhouse the name,
    **eh_Fabrikam** and click on **Create**.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image35.png){width="3.4002909011373577in"
height="1.9529363517060367in"}

4.  This is where you will ultimately stream data from various sources
    through the rest of the training today. When the item is created, a
    window will appear giving you some details about the Eventhouse.
    Click on the **Get started** button.

![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image36.png){width="3.3241251093613298in"
height="3.1277832458442694in"}

5.  Take a quick tour of the Eventhouse by following the green tooltips
    on your screen. This first one shows that an empty Kusto Query
    Language (KQL) Database was created with the Eventhouse.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image38.png){width="3.8048359580052495in"
height="2.278028215223097in"}

6.  Follow the remainder of the tooltips around the screen to show you
    where to create additional databases, check the storage in OneLake
    of the Eventhouse, check the usage of Fabric resources in compute
    minutes, and finally see what actions have occurred in the
    Eventhouse.

7.  Within the navigational pane of the Eventhouse, find your KQL
    Database that was created alongside the Eventhouse. Click on the
    ellipses (...) and then select the option **Open in new tab**.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image39.png){width="2.645797244094488in"
height="2.8753127734033246in"}

8.  This will allow us to still have one tab in our browser to see the
    overview of our entire Eventhouse and a new tab to focus on the KQL
    Database properties. One goal that we wish to accomplish in our
    scenario is ensuring that the data streamed to the KQL database is
    accessible via OneLake. By enabling this feature, we make the data
    in this KQL Database easily discoverable through shortcuts to be
    used in any Lakehouse we may want. Click on the pencil icon next to
    the **OneLake availability** property.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically

height="2.126861329833771in"}

9.  Enable this property by toggling the switch to **Active** and then
    click on **Done** at the bottom of the window.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](vertopal_ae64eb88f15d412c9ef639c5bf497c24/media/image41.png){width="2.9140682414698165in"
height="1.6834940944881889in"}

10. Return to your **RTI_username** workspace.

11. If you see the **Task Flows** option, grab the anchor point in the
    middle of the screen and slide the menu up to the top of your screen
    to hide. \
    \

    height="3.1979166666666665in"}

12. You now have the basis for how you will begin to ingest the
    streaming data into your OneLake. The next step is to create a
    stream of data that can receive the data in motion.
