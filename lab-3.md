# Microsoft Fabric - Real-Time Intelligence in a Day: Lab 3

![](../media/Lab-01/image001.png)

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along with associated
screenshots that provide visual aid. In each screenshot, sections are
highlighted with orange boxes to indicate the area(s) user should focus
on.

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create another Eventstream to ingest additional
data into our existing Eventhouse. We will see how to include
transformations within the Eventstream to control what data we want to
be adding to the KQL database.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- Eventstream Processing and Transformation
- Writing KQL Queries to Join Data from an External Database
- Exploring KQL Data within Power BI

## Fabric Eventstreams

### Task 1: Create an Eventstream

1. Open the **Fabric workspace** you have been using for the course today.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image62.png)

2. There is additional streaming data for us to ingest related to our
   e-commerce store. For this Eventstream, though, we will want to
   transform the data prior to loading it into the Eventhouse. Instead
   of going to the **"Real-Time Hub"** we can create a new Eventstream
   directly from the workspace. From the **+ New** dropdown menu,
   create a new **Eventstream**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image67.png)

3. Give the new Eventstream the name, **es_Fabrikam_ClickEvents**,
   check the **"Enhanced Capabilities"** option, and then click on
   **Create**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image68.png)

4. Under the Home ribbon, click on the **Add source** dropdown and then
   select **External sources**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image69.png)

5. Similarly to the previous lab, we will be connecting to an Azure
   Event Hub which has data being streamed to from a Python notebook.
   Click on the **"Azure Event Hubs"** tile.

    ![A screenshot of a web page Description automatically generated](./media/image70.png)

6. Create a **New connection**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image71.png)

7. From your environment details page, copy and paste all the necessary
   connection settings into the appropriate fields.

    - Event Hub namespace: **realtimeconsumersiad**
    - Event Hub: **rta-iad-clicks**
    - Shared Access Key Name: **rti-reader**
    - Shared Access Key: **H/5gTWuI+lQLT9HYBzuqzPdKaR6YWXCRw+AEhE6k1gE=**

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image72.png)

8. Once all the properties have been filled out, click on **Connect**.

9. In the configuration of the Azure Event Hub data source, you will
   need to modify the **Consumer group** of the Event Hub to ensure
   that you gain access to a unique access point to the stream of data.
   Within your **Environment details** find the property that lists
   what your consumer group name will be and place that into the field
   box. It will appear something like "**cg-xx**"

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image73.png)

10. Click on **Next**.

11. On the review and create window, verify that everything is configured correctly and click **Add**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image74.png)

12. Once the stream is configured, you will be able to see a preview of
    the data coming from the Event Hub.

    ![A table of numbers and numbers Description automatically generated](./media/image75.png)

13. Examine the data being received. There are two types of events that
    are logged from the e-commerce website: clicks and impressions.

    - **IMPRESSION** - An impression event is recorded each time an
      advertisement or a product listing is displayed to a user.
      Impressions are a measure of how many times an item (ad or product)
      is viewed, regardless of whether it is interacted with.

    - **CLICK** - A click event is recorded when a user interacts with an
      item by clicking on it. This usually indicates a higher level of
      engagement compared to an impression.

    In addition to the clicks and impression events that are logged, there
    are details about what product the click or impression was for, what
    device and browser the webpage was loaded from, and what IP address
    accessed the page and how long the page took to load.

### Task 2: Transform the Eventstream

1. You will now take this stream of data and transform it to fit into
   your KQL Database in a way that can be easily understood for
   analysts looking to derive insights from this data. Within the
   Eventstream canvas, click on the dropdown for the **Transform
   events** object.

    ![A screenshot of a chat](./media/image76.png)

2. From the list of available operations, select the **Manage fields**
   option.

    ![A screenshot of a search box Description automatically generated](./media/image77.png)

3. On the new icon that appears called **Manage_fields1**, click on the
   **pencil icon** to select what fields you wish to add to your stream
   from the source.

    ![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image78.png)

4. In the flyout pane that appears, click on the button the option to
   **Add all fields**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image79.png)

5. From the list of fields, select the one called **PartitionId** and
   click on the ellipses (...) that appears when you hover over the field.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image80.png)

6. Choose the option to **Remove** that field. For this stream of data
   coming from the Event Hub, partitioning is not being used, so this
   column is not helpful to us, thus we are removing it.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image81.png)

7. Remove all the following fields that will not be needed for this
   stream:

    - userAgent
    - page_loading_seconds
    - EventProcessedUtcTime
    - EventEnqueredUtcTime

    You should be left with the following fields:

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image82.png)

8. Hover over the **eventDate** field and when an ellipses (...) appears on
   the right-hand side of the window, click it.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image83.png)

9. Choose the option, **Edit**.

    ![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image84.png)

10. Click on the **Change type toggle** to modify the data type of this
    field. The original type is a String; you need to modify the
    **Converted Type** to **DateTime**. After you have finished, click on
    **Save**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image85.png)

11. Click on the **Refresh** button in your Eventstream Test result
    pane. These are the fields that you want to load to a KQL Database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image86.png)

### Task 3: Split Eventstream and Load Two Destinations

1. While you could load this stream of data to a KQL Database for
   analysis, you may want to have another way to consume this data to
   differentiate CLICK events and IMPRESSION events. Add another
   transformation activity to the user interface by hovering over the
   end of the **Manage_Fields1** transform.

    ![A screen shot of a computer screen Description automatically generated](./media/image87.png)

2. Choose the **Filter** transform from the available list of
   operations.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image88.png)

3. Click on the **pencil icon** on the new transformation, **Filter1**.

    ![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image89.png)

4. In the flyout that appears on the right-hand side of the screen,
   customize the filter conditions to reflect a way to only return
   CLICK values by using the values below. It is important to note that
   the Filter transform is case sensitive.

    - **Operation name** - Clicks
    - **Select a field to filter on** - eventType
    - **Keep events when the value** - equals -- CLICK **(Important! This
      is a case sensitive field, ensure to input in all capitals for this
      example)**

    ![A screenshot of a screen Description automatically generated](./media/image90.png)

5. Choose the **Save** option to keep your changes.

6. Click on the **Refresh** button again to verify the data has been
   filtered to CLICK eventTypes.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image91.png)

7. This may be the only field that you're interested in sending to a
   table, but another option is to instead create two separate streams
   to route different information to two or more tables. From the
   **Home** ribbon of the Eventstream, click on the **Transform events**
   dropdown and then select **Filter**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image92.png)

8. A new object called **Filter1 (Name may differ)** will appear on
   your canvas. You will need to connect the **Manage_fields1 stream**
   to the new filter transformation. Drag a line from the green dot on
   one transform to another to make that connection.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image93.png)

9. Click on the **pencil icon** for **Filter2** to edit its settings.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image94.png)

10. In the flyout that appears on the right-hand side of the screen,
    customize the filter conditions to reflect a way to only return
    IMPRESSION values by using the values below. Remember that the
    Filter transform is case sensitive.

    - **Operation name** - Impressions
    - **Select a field to filter on** - eventType
    - **Keep events when the value** - equals -- IMPRESSION **(Important!
      This is a case sensitive field, ensure to input in all capitals for
      this example)**

    ![A screenshot of a screen Description automatically generated](./media/image95.png)

11. Choose the **Save** option to keep your changes.

12. Before we load the data into new tables within our KQL Database, we
    can remove additional columns which are not needed. In this case, for
    the stream of data filtered for our "CLICK" records, we no longer need
    the "eventType" column since every row holds the same value. For our
    "IMPRESSION" stream of data, we can remove the "eventType" column for
    the same reasons mentioned above, and we can also remove the "referrer"
    column as it is empty for every row in this table.

13. Click on the **+ icon** after the **Clicks** filter operation.

    ![A white board with writing on it Description automatically generated](./media/image96.png)

14. In the dropdown menu, select **Manage fields**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image97.png)

15. Click on the **pencil icon** to select what fields you wish to
    add/remove to your stream.

    ![A white rectangular sign with black text Description automatically generated](./media/image98.png)

16. Rename the operation to **Manage_Clicks**. Also, select **Add all
    fields** then remove **eventType**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image99.png)

17. Next, add another **Manage fields** transform connected to the
    **Impressions** filter as seen below.

    ![A diagram of a rectangle with a rectangle and a rectangle with a rectangle with a rectangle with a rectangle with a rectangle with a rectangle with a rectangle with](./media/image100.png)

18. Click on the **pencil icon** to select what fields you wish to
    add/remove to your stream.

    ![A white card with a pen and a red box Description automatically generated](./media/image101.png)

19. Rename the operation to **Manage_Impressions**. Then select **Add all
    fields** then remove **eventType** and **referrer**. Your **Manage fields**
    transform should look like the following:

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image102.png)

20. Now that you have cleaned up the data for the streams for each of
    the types of events, you need to load each stream into a new table
    on the KQL Database. Click on the **+ icon** after the
    **Manage_Clicks** manage fields operation.

    ![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image103.png)

21. In the dropdown list that appears, go to the **Destinations** and select
    **KQL Database**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image104.png)

22. Click on the **pencil icon** for the **KQL_Database1** operation.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image105.png)

23. For this destination, configure the following properties:

    - **Destination name** -- dbo-Clicks
    - **Workspace** - RTI_username
    - **KQL Database** - eh_Fabrikam
    - **Destination Table** - Create a new table called **Clicks**

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image106.png)

24. Click on **Save** at the bottom of the flyout.

25. Do the same thing for the Impressions table with the following
    information configured as below.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image107.png)

26. Save your changes.

27. This Eventstream is now ready to begin streaming. Click on
    **Publish** to begin that stream.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image108.png)

28. With the Eventstream now running, you should see the Eventstream
    user interface slightly change to signify that you are streaming the
    data from Event Hub, transforming and splitting that data stream, and
    loading it into two separate KQL Database tables.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image109.png)

## Adding More Data to KQL Database

### Task 4: Validate Event Data Tables

1. Return to your **RTI_username** workspace.

2. Open the **eh_Fabrikam** KQL Database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image110.png)

3. With the Eventstream running, you should now see two new tables on
   the KQL Database Overview page. After letting the Eventstream run
   for several hours, you will see that the **Top tables** within the
   KQL Database will be displayed on the Overview page and show how
   much data is stored within the table.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image111.png)

4. Click on the **Impressions** table. This table receives about 1.5
   million records every 24 hours. There are many more impressions than
   Clicks, so this will be your largest table for the purposes of this
   class.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image112.png)

### Task 5: Create KQL Database Shortcuts for Dimension Tables

Up to this point you have been working with streaming data, but are still missing some critical elements to be able to derive intelligence from the data you have brought in. In this task we will bring in data from an external Azure SQL Database which will serve as dimension tables within our KQL Database. This will allow us to better describe the data we are streaming currently. For example, all our tables contain a form of Product ID which is a numeric field, but it would be better if we had some sort of Product name to be able to display. The data we need to support this is currently in an external Azure SQL Database, let's see how easy it is to make connections to some of these dimension tables.

1. In the **eh_Fabrikam** database, click on the drop-down menu called **New related item**. Then choose the option that says KQL Queryset.

   ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image113.png)

2. Give the KQL Queryset the name **Create Tables** and then click the **Create** button.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image114.png)

3. The OneLake data hub will open up and the only option to select with be the **"eh_Fabrikam"** kql database. Select this database and click **"Connect"**.

   ![A screenshot of a chat](./media/image115.png)

4. In the new interface click once within the query window and highlight all the text by using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + A**. Once everything has been highlighted, delete everything.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image116.png)

5. In the blank query window enter the following KQL script. This script will create a connection to an external Azure SQL Database and make it available within our KQL database as a **Shortcut**. A **Shortcut** is attached in a read-only mode, making it possible to view and run queries alongside the streaming data that was ingested into the KQL database.

   ![](./media/image117.emf)

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image118.png)

6. Click the **Run** button to execute the script.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image119.png)

7. In your Database Explorer window, you will now see a new folder called **Shortcuts** and within the folder you should see two additional tables that are linked to this KQL Database. These tables exist within an Azure SQL Database, but through the script you executed, you now have them linked to this KQL Database to be joined with your InternetSales and event tables.

   ![A screenshot of a search box](./media/image120.png)

8. Now that you have dimensional qualities to your database, you can answer questions and give more context to consumers of the reports and queries these tables off insights on across your business. Run the following KQL query to see one of them.

   ![](./media/image121.emf)

9. You will now see in your query results values for each individual product that your company has sold.

   ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image122.png)

10. With your query highlighted click on the button in your toolbar, **Build Power BI report**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image123.png)

11. This gives you the opportunity to create a Power BI report using the data within your KQL Database. Feel free to explore this for a few moments, but you will not need to create a report from this data just yet. Click the **X button** in the top-right corner when you are ready to move forward.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image124.png)

12. Navigate back to the **eh_Fabrikam** KQL Database.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image125.png)

13. Click on the **Shortcuts** option within the **eh_Fabrikam** navigation pane. This will show you all the shortcuts you have created to this KQL Database. It should be noted that these Shortcuts are considered classical Azure Data Explorer external tables using Azure SQL external table syntax and are constructed differently than OneLake, ADLS, or S3 shortcuts which are also supported in KQL Database within Fabric.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image126.png)

## Summary

In this lab, you created another stream of data but were able to transform the stream using the user interface of the Eventstream in Fabric. Loading the data to two separate tables has allowed you to track all the clicks and impressions within your e-commerce system for marketing, advertising, and analysis purposes. You also created a shortcut to an external Azure SQL Database using the KQL Queryset external table feature. You now have a few dimensions to better understand the context of the sales and clicks within your KQL Database.
